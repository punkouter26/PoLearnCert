Increasing bandwidth also does not address the root cause of the attack.","DifficultyLevel":"Intermediate","CreatedDate":"2025-11-04T00:00:41.8788774Z","CreatedDate@odata.type":"Edm.DateTime","Timestamp":"2025-11-04T00:00:41.8797328Z","Timestamp@odata.type":"Edm.DateTime"},"lastModifiedTime":"2025-11-04T00:00:41.8797328Z","eTag":"W/\"datetime'2025-11-04T00%3A00%3A41.8797328Z'\"","meta":{"revision":0,"created":1762214441879,"version":0},"$loki":221},{"PartitionKey":"SECPLUS","RowKey":"QTHREATS-008","properties":{"PartitionKey":"SECPLUS","RowKey":"QTHREATS-008","SubtopicId":"THREATS","Text":"A company's web server was compromised due to an SQL injection attack.

Input validation, while useful, does not specifically protect against SQL injections. A web application firewall may help detect attacks but won't prevent them if the application code is vulnerable.
